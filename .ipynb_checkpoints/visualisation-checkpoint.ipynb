    "<h2>Connecting Patterns across both plots and discussing implications</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "<b>High Violation Count and High Violation Speed</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the data shows high violations (plot 1) while high violation speed (plot 2, potentially exceeding the 90th percentile). This could imply significant risk as these events are severe for the safety of road users. This pattern might suggest widespread aggressive driving or conditions where drivers feel emboldened to speed excessively, warranting urgent attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>High Violation Count and Moderate/Low Average Violation Speed</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "A high number of violations (Plot 1) paired with an average violator speed that is only moderately above the limit (Plot 2) could imply widespread, but less severe, non-compliance. The implication here might be less about overtly reckless individuals and more about systemic issues like unclear speed limits, road design encouraging slightly higher speeds, or a general underestimation of speed by many drivers. For example, during the start of rush hour or the end of rush hour, where more vehicles are more eager to speed modestly to \"beat the traffic\" to get home quicker. However, the presence of other vehicles (even if not yet fully congested) might naturally temper the average speed of those violating from becoming excessively high. There's less opportunity for extreme speeding compared to an empty road.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Low violations Count and high violation speed</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If violation counts are low (Plot 1) but the average speed of these few violators is exceptionally high (Plot 2), this points towards isolated incidents of extreme speeding. The implication is a different risk profile – fewer offenders, but those who offend do so at dangerously high speeds, suggesting a need for targeted enforcement against high-risk individuals. For example, extreme speeding commonly occurs around midnight due to lack of enforcement and low traffic on freeways.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>How Spikes and Drops in violation affect</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "A noticeable drop in violation count (Plot 1) often coincides with a *gap* in average speed (Plot 2). This suggests either a temporary absence of incoming vehicles or a general adherence to speed limits during that period. Such trends may reflect low traffic volume, offering valuable insight into traffic behavior and enforcement effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These connected patterns allow authorities to move beyond simply counting violations to understanding the nature and potential severity of speeding behaviors at different times. This nuanced understanding has direct implications for tailoring enforcement strategies, public awareness campaigns, and road safety engineering efforts. For example, widespread minor speeding might call for educational campaigns or traffic calming measures, while isolated extreme speeding might necessitate targeted patrols.\n",

    "## Operational Decisions and Triggering Alerts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dual-plot visualization not only presents violation data effectively but also incorporates dynamic annotations and statistical indicators that support **real-time operational insights** and the potential for **automated alerts**. These features elevate the dashboard from a static report to a responsive decision-support tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The clear temporal breakdown of **violation counts** and **average speeds** enables traffic authorities to make **data-driven enforcement and planning decisions**. Key use cases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Violation Count Hours:**  \n",
    "  When violation counts are consistently high,especially if paired with average speeds exceeding the 90th percentile,it signals areas of **elevated risk**, justifying the deployment of mobile speed cameras, increased patrol frequency, or temporary signage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spike Annotations:**  \n",
    "  Green-shaded regions, which denote sudden spikes in violations, may correspond to **temporary environmental or behavioral changes** such as construction detours, weather impacts, or bottlenecks. These should be flagged for operational review.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Speeding Trends:**  \n",
    "  Visual references such as the **average speed line** and **90th percentile line** allow authorities to distinguish between **routine low-level non-compliance** and **extreme speeding events**, which may require distinct intervention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inclusion of these elements supports **adaptive traffic management**, enabling response strategies that are informed by the latest real-time trends and historic baselines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization goes beyond descriptive analytics to support **prescriptive actions**. It does this through:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Real-time annotations of violations and speeds, including **min/max labels**.\n",
    "- **Baseline indicators** (average and 90th percentile) that contextualize observed values.\n",
    "- **Shaded regions** that draw immediate attention to **critical changes** in violation behavior.\n",
    "- Automatic **time interpolation**, ensuring even low-activity periods are visually represented for consistent monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "These visual cues are more than informative—they are **operational triggers**. For example, a spike shaded in green combined with a speed above the 90th percentile could be configured to **automatically alert enforcement teams**. Similarly, a sudden drop in violations may indicate **reduced traffic flow** or **sensor malfunction**, prompting system diagnostics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the visualization is not only insightful but also actionable, by demonstrating how **visual features directly support operational decisions and proactive alerting** in a traffic management context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Future enhancements could include integrating external data sources such as weather, events, or roadworks to better explain anomalies in violation patterns. Implementing automated anomaly detection models could provide real-time alerts for unusual spikes in speed or count. Segmenting violations by type (instantaneous vs. average) may offer clearer behavioral insights, while comparing trends across multiple days or weeks could uncover recurring patterns. Visual markers indicating enforcement changes (e.g., patrols or camera adjustments) would support intervention analysis. Lastly, adding user-defined filters and thresholds would make the tool more adaptable for diverse operational contexts.\n",

    "<h1>Part 2: Map Visualisation</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Overview</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "This static map visualization offers a complementary spatial perspective to the time-series graph by rendering filtered traffic violation data within a specific time window. By incorporating camera geolocations and aggregated violation statistics (both instantaneous and average speed), the map provides actionable insights into spatial non-compliance patterns.This approach emphasizes filtered snapshot analysis, which enables investigators to focus on specific windows of interest, such as rush hours or late-night intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Map Description and Features</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Instantaneous Violations (Circle Markers)</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Content: </b>Each camera location is marked with a colored circle, representing the total number of instantaneous speed violations within the selected filter window (e.g., between 08:00 and 09:00 on a specific day or a span of multiple days).</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b><font color='blue'>Key Features and Importance: </font></b></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Color coded Markers based on Violation Count</b></p>\n",
    "<p>The marker color ranges from blue (low count) to orange and red (high count), simulating a heatmap-like effect. This makes it easy to visually identify hotspots of speeding behavior without relying on time playback.y</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Popup with Camera ID and Violation Count:</b></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Each marker includes a popup showing the specific camera ID and the number of violations during the selected time window. This supports fine-grained, location-specific analysis for operational planning (e.g., camera recalibration, on-site signage).</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Total Violations Displayed Regardless of Filter:</b></p>\n",
    "<p>In addition to filtered counts, the popups include total violation statistics across the entire dataset. This enables temporal comparison — analysts can see whether a spike or drop in the filtered window is typical or abnormal for that camera.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Average Speed Violations (Polylines)</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Content</b>\n",
    "Routes between consecutive cameras are drawn as polylines, with line thickness and color encoding the number of average speed violations detected along those paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'>Key Features and Importance:</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Color-Graded Lines Reflecting Violation Volume: </b>\n",
    "<p>Gray, purple, and red are used to visually represent low, moderate, and high average-speed violations, respectively. This visual coding highlights which road segments between checkpoints are most frequently abused.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Line Thickness Scaling with Violation Count: </b>\n",
    "<p>Thicker lines represent routes with a higher number of filtered violations, making severity intuitively clear.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Tooltip Showing Both Filtered and Cumulative Violations: </b>\n",
    "<p>Hovering over any line reveals the violation count for the current window and the total historical average violations along that route. This dual insight allows observers to contextualize whether the filtered snapshot aligns with long-term trends or is an anomaly.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Tooltip Displaying Violations within and between Cameras</b>\n",
    "<p>This popup displays a detailed summary of vehicles that exceeded the speed limit within the selected time window for each camera. It includes the car plate, rounded speed reading, and the timestamp of each violation. If more than 10 violations are recorded, the popup indicates how many additional records exist beyond those shown. This can be adjusted</p>\n",

    "<h3><b>Operational Usefulness:</b></h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Traffic authorities can use the visual cues to determine where enforcement deployment (e.g., mobile patrols, signage) is most needed.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Camera effectiveness and coverage gaps become visible by comparing low-activity vs. high-activity areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of both filtered and total stats encourages temporal benchmarking whereby users can assess whether behavior in the filtered window is within normal range or indicates a sudden surge in risky driving.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3><b>Future Extensions:</b></h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>To further enhance this static map, future iterations could incorporate an hourly slider filter to enable comparison across time windows. This makes it easier to detect trends or shifts in violation patterns. Additionally, integrating other data sources such as weather conditions or scheduled events (e.g public holidays) can help unexpected spikes in violations, providing richer insights based on deeper contextual insights, same suggestion as mentioned in Part 1. For scalability, especially in larger networks with many cameras, implementing violation density contours or cluster-based aggregation would improve visual clarity and allow for more effective high-level monitoring.\n",
